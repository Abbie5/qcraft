# qCraft Reimagined

A reimagination of qCraft for modern Minecraft.

## About

[qCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/qcraft) is a mod that introduced many concepts of Quantum Physics into Minecraft. It was beloved by the community for its novel ideas and interesting capabilities; unfortunately, its development lay dormant for many years. **qCraft Reimagined** aims to bring the mod back into the spotlight.

## Features

- Blocks that change state depending on the face observed
- Practical redstone randomness
- Machines that will perform quantum observations automatically
- Computers that can swap entire regions of the world
- 
...and much more! See the [wiki](https://github.com/acikek/qcraft/wiki) for in-depth feature explanations and tutorials.

## Credits

- This mod wouldn't have been possible without fantastic art by VirtuaLilith. I may have programmed the internal logic, but she really brought the mod to life!
- Trudle helped me with Portuguese localization; I'm not exactly fluent yet.
- Mind-boggling math problems were solved by the Quilt community, most notably supersaiyansubtlety... they saved me many headaches.
